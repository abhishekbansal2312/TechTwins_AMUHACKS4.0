```
User -> Upload Document -> OCR Processing -> PII Detection -> Validation -> Redaction/Notification -> Dashboard
     -> Chat/Voice -> Intent Recognition -> Knowledge Base Query -> Response Generation -> User Interface
```

### Database Schema

The application uses a relational database with six primary tables:

- **Users**: Stores core user information and subscription status
- **Documents**: Tracks uploaded documents and processing status
- **PII_Detections**: Records identified PII instances and remediation actions
- **Payments**: Tracks all financial transactions
- **Chat_History**: Stores user-chatbot conversations for context awareness
- **Voice_Sessions**: Records voice interaction metadata and transcriptions

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üìö Core Functionalities

### PII Detection Workflow

1. User uploads document through the dashboard
2. Backend extracts text content using OCR technology
3. PII detection algorithms identify sensitive information
4. Validation step confirms PII through checksums and context
5. Optional automatic redaction or notification of detected PII
6. Results are stored in database and displayed in dashboard

### Chatbot Assistant

1. Users interact with the AI-powered chatbot through text or voice
2. NLP models interpret user intent and extract key information
3. Chatbot connects to document database and knowledge base to provide context-aware answers
4. Responses are generated focusing on privacy best practices and guidance
